# franz-webapp
Franz/Ferdi recipe for Kopano WebApp

## Installation

This recipe needs to be cloned/extracted to a folder called `kopano-webapp` that is located below either:

- Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/
- Windows: %appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/
- Linux: ~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev

(Just replace `Franz` with `Ferdi` in case you are using Ferdi)

Afterwards click "Add new service" within Franz/Ferdi and select "Custom Services". Here the above plugin should then be listed below "Community 3rd Party Recipes".
